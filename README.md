## Description

The GraphGeometry project focuses on mathematical groups and symmetries using Java programming. It explores the concept of groups and their properties, especially closure, associativity, identity element, and inverse, within various shapes and graphs.

## Prerequisites

To work with the GraphGeometry project, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8 or later
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Installation

1. Clone the GraphGeometry repository to your local machine (if you haven't already).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GraphGeometry.git
$ cd GraphGeometry
```

## Usage
 
 To compile and run the code locally

```bash
$ javac Main.java 
$ java Main
```
Follow the prompts in the command-line interface to explore the mathematical groups, symmetries, and shapes implemented in the project.

## Class Details
###v FiniteGroupOfOrderTwo
An implementation of a finite group {Â±1} under standard multiplication of real numbers.

### RadialGraph
A class representing a RadialGraph, which is a graph with nodes connected only to a central node by directed edges.

### Square
A class representing a Square, defined by four Point objects arranged in a specific order.

### SquareSymmetries
A class providing symmetries of the Square shape. Implements the Symmetries interface.

### RadialGraphSymmetries
A class providing rotational symmetries of the RadialGraph. Implements the Symmetries interface.
